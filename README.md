# premote

`premote` is meant to be used when you're in a pinch and don't have a
presentation remote handy. I often leave my presentation remote in my laptop
bag, which does me no good when presenting at my university with only my
backpack. `premote` was born as my solution to this problem.

See individual components (such as `premote-server`, `premote-android`) for
information about how each part works (along with license information).
